// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called name and assign it a value of Dane   
// So we make a conditional checking if the name variable is also/exactly equal to Mary
//it'll code/console.log 'Hi, Mary'
//if it doesn't it'll code 'How do you do'
//Dane doesn't equal or is the same as Mary
//so we console.log 'How do you do?'
//

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called secret  
// Make another variable called code and assign it a value of 123
// Then we make a conditional checking if code is exactly 123 which it is then the value of secret will be 'super'
// After, the code is multiplied by 2 resulting in a second if conditional stating 
// Then we check if the updated code is greater than 250 if true value of secret will be 'duper' 
//246 isn't greater than 250
//So we console.log secret 'super'


//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called isStudent and assign it a boolean value of true
// make another variable called age and assign it a value of 34
// make another variable called zip and assign it a value of 55407
// We make a conditional checking to see if isStudent equals to true and zip is greater than 80000 to console.log 'You're a student on the west coast'
// which it isn't so we skip over that code
// The second 'if' chain states isStudent equals to false or age is less than 30 to console.log 'What are your hobbies?'
// this if chain is not true so we go to the next else chain
// The next else if chain is if isStudent equals to true to console.log 'Welcome to Prime'
// The last else chain is if none of the other else if chains work to console.log 'How about the weather?'
// We console.log 'Welcome to Prime'

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
Problem: Instructions say colorOne is blue but code says red
Solutions: Change colorOne from red to blue
let colorOne = 'red';
Problem: Instructions say colorTwo is red but code says blue
Solution: Change colorTwo from blue to red
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;
Problem: Instructions is saying an 'and' compound conditional but code is insisting if it's a 'or' compound conditional
Solution: Switch || to &&
if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;

Problem: minAge is less than or equal to age
Solution: change code to 'age >= minAge' 
if(minAge <= age) {
Problem: the console.log will say 'no entry' when instructions want 'enter'
Solution: Switch console.log around to have 'enter' first and 'no entry' as the else chain  
console.log('no entry');
} else {
  console.log('enter');
}
